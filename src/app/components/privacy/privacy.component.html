    activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing
    DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism
    that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted
    that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy
    notice. </div>
